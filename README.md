# ASCII-Animation
Animation with just "printf" function in C language. I've provided three different animations. Check the "code" folder to see how the animations get generated. The code is programmed by [Rejwan Islam Rizvy](https://www.facebook.com/RIR360)

**Note:** *system("cls") function is required to refresh the terminal. Your system must support it.*
